Given a [`hafas-client@5`](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client/tree/5)-compatible HAFAS client, a time frame, and a bounding box or [`GeoJSON`](https://geojson.org) shape, `hafas-generate-gtfs` tries to build a GTFS feed for the area:

1. Finds all stations in the area.
2. Fetches all departures at these stations within the time frame.
3. Fetches the trip for each departure.


## Installation

```shell
npm install hafas-generate-gtfs
```


## Usage

```js
todo
```

I recommend you to use this package with a [caching](https://github.com/public-transport/cached-hafas-client) HAFAS client.
